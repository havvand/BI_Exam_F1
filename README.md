# Business Intelligence Project

## Problem Formulation
Formula One produces vast amounts of data during qualifying, racing and testing. The data covers everything from driver performance metrics, telemetry, pit stops and weather conditions. 

We want to apply BI and relevant methods we have learned to analyze Formula One data. We want to identify KPIâ€™s that influence race outcomes and try predicting future race outcomes using Machine Learning/AI.

### Research Questions
1. We want to examine the driver data, race and lap times, qualifying times and pitstop times to determine which factors influence the outcome of races.
2. Analyze historical (2018-2023) pitstop data to identify general trends and patterns in optimal pitstop windows, independent of specific race conditions.
3. Predict the impact of weather changes (rain) on pace and pitstop strategy through models.
4. Predictive Analytics: Develop models to predict race winners and exciting race moments to enhance fan engagement and viewership.
